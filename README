BUTTONS

 - Engine / World Operations

   F2            : fps toggle, displays average over 10 frames
                   (console)

   F3            : decrease Minimum Critters
   F4            : increase Minimum Critters

   F5            : increase energy in the system by the energy amount of 25 food
   F6            : decrease energy in the system by the energy amount of 25 food

   F7            : insert Adam

   F8            : toggle Timed Food Inserts
                   this will insert 100 extra food every 3 generations, and thus
                   artificially drives the population up and down.

   F9            : increase nr of actual mutations when a critter mutates
   F10           : decrease nr of actual mutations when a critter mutates

   F11           : increase mutation rate (%)
   F12           : decrease mutation rate (%)

   Insert        : toggle hide critter retinas.

   w             : create a horizontal wall
   x             : destroy the wall
   c             : toggle gate in wall center

   f             : toggle follow the youngest critter untill it dies.

   Page Up       : load all critters from "~/.critterding/load" directory
   Page Down     : save all critters into "~/.critterding/save/(timestamp)" directory

   keypad +      : increase energy in the system by the energy amount of 1 food
   keypad -      : decrease energy in the system by the energy amount of 1 food

 - Camera Operations

   Arrow Up      : move forward
   Arrow Down    : move backward
   Arrow Left    : strafe left
   Arrow Right   : strafe right
   Home          : move up
   End           : move down
   NumKey 2      : look up
   NumKey 8      : look down
   NumKey 4      : look left
   NumKey 6      : look right


OTHER THINGS

 - Make sure the retina boxes in the lower left of the window never leave the
   boundaries of the window.  Offscreen rendering is not supported by almost any
   video card drivers.  For some drivers you are not even allowed to minimize the window or
   change desktops.  You should notice a big dropoff in population when this occurs.

 - Slow videocards will gain some performance gains by making the window's width smaller.
   Again watch out the retinas do not leave the window boundaries, the option --retinasperrow
   can be used to level your needs.

 - Hiding the retinas is (slightly) more costly than leaving them on.
